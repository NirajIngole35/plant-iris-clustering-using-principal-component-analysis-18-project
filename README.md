**Plant Iris Clustering using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

This project shows how to group different types of Iris plants using PCA. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning.

**Dataset :=**
The Iris dataset has 150 samples of iris plants, each with 4 features:

Sepal length (cm)

Sepal width (cm)

Petal length (cm)

Petal width (cm)

The dataset also has labels for three types of **iris plants:=**

Setosa

Versicolour

Virginica

Project Steps

We will reduce the data from 4 features to 2 features using PCA and then visualize the clusters.

**Requirements :=**
You need the following packages:

Python 3.x

pandas


scikit-learn

matplotlib

**Explanation :=**

**Load the dataset:=** We load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.

**Extract data and labels:=** We get the features (x) and labels (y) from the dataset.

**Apply PCA:=** We reduce the data from 4 features to 2 features.

**Plot the data:=** We create a plot to show the data in 2D, using different colors for different types of iris plants.

**Results:=**

The plot will show three clusters, each representing a different type of iris plant.

**Conclusion :=**
PCA helps us reduce the number of features and visualize high-dimensional data in 2D. This project shows how PCA can be used to cluster iris plants.
